# Self Evaluation

- **How might the `.each` method be useful?** The `.each` method seems extremely useful for automating tasks or functions.
- **What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?** I know that sometimes it is useful to have nested arrays, so I am interested to learn use cases and steps to interate through those as well.
- **What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this assignment?** I think that I had a mentality to just-try-it and see what happens. I think this helped me to truly understand what works and what does not work, with less time spent in a google rabbit hole.
